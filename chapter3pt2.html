            Looking at the carnage around us, 
            <br>
            even the heavens shake. 
            <br><br>
            The goat looks at me mournfully, 
            <br>
            “This wasn’t a very good welcome was it?”
            <br>
            “I’ve had better” 
            <br>
            I can’t help but laugh,
            <br><br>
            “Max,”
            <br>
            “{insert name}”
            <br>
            “Pleasure to meet you.”
            <br>
            “You too."" 
            <br><br>
            "Though I must say, 
            <br>
            do you not have brain damage from all this headbutting? 
            <br>
            I am rather concerned for your sanity. 
            <br>
            I know that you are cursed no more, 
            <br>
            but I wonder whether this episode will leave you permanently injured. 
            <br>
            A concussion perhaps?”
            <br><br>
            <!--will need to fix storyline from this part-->
            With tears falling out his eyes, I make out, “Are y-y-ou w-w-orried about m-m-me?” *uwu uwu*
            “Well of course I am Max, you’re my friend
            “R-r-really?” 
            “Definitely”
