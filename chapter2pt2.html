        <p>
            My voice starts slow, 
            <br>
            before it speeds up, 
            <br>
            rising to a steady tempo, 
            <br>
            before crashing down like thunder. 
            <br>The purple swirls away like waves.
            <br><br>
            The soft balls of fluff run towards me, 
            <br>
            barreling into my core, 
            <br>
            burying their little heads into my sides.
            <br><br>
            “Thank you!” "Thank you!"
            <br><br>
            “I am sorry, I don’t know what came over me,” 
            <br>
            Charleens warm voice pulls me away from the chirping of her babies. 
            <br><br>
            “Charleen, no harm has been done, all shall be fine.”
            <br>
            I watch the fog swirl away, 
            <br>
            painting patterns on the dirt and brush, 
            <br>
            a trail.
            <br><br>    
            “Please, come and have some tea with us!”
            <br>
            “I’m sorry Charleen! Got to run, perhaps another time.”
            <br><br>
            I followed the trails into the woods
