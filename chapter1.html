<div class="story">
    <p>
        As the dirt path trickles down into cobbled roads that wind through coloured cottages with thatched roofs I see the battered and weathered sign “WELCOME TO THE CHICKEN VILLAGE!” The white paint peeling and splotchy. 
        <br><br>
        “Ian!” I call, but the old businessman doesn’t heed my call. “Old friend, will you not come and talk to me?” My voice, was loud in the wind. 
        <br><br>
        “You are not welcome here {insert name}, bringer of bad news. Gizem is the only way forward.” Ian's voice rasps, drawing on and on like thinly stretched linen. 
        <br><br>
        His pupils wide and empty like two dark holes. Purple fog swirls in them. Cursed.

        I must help him. Ian is the only person who can help me on my quest to find Gizem, the Unpleasant Toad.
