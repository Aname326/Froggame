            As the dirt path trickles down into cobbled roads 
            <br>
            that wind through coloured cottages with thatched roofs 
            <br>
            I see the battered and weathered sign “WELCOME TO THE CHICKEN VILLAGE!” 
            <br>
            The white paint peeling and splotchy. 
            <br><br>
            “Ian!” I call, 
            <br>
            but the old businessman doesn’t heed my call. 
            <br>
            “Old friend, will you not come and talk to me?” 
            <br>
            My voice, was loud in the wind. 
            <br><br>
            “You are not welcome here {insert name}, bringer of bad news. 
            <br>
            Gizem is the only way forward.” 
            <br>
            Ian's voice rasps, drawing on and on like thinly stretched linen. 
            <br><br>
            His pupils wide and empty like two dark holes. 
            <br>
            Purple fog swirls in them. 
            <br>
            Cursed.
            <br><br>
            I must help him. 
            <br>Ian is the only person who can help me on my quest to find Gizem, the Unpleasant Toad.
