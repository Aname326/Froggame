            They say the wind speaks, 
            <br>
            but can you hear their whispers?
            <br>
            The trees carry the voices of those forgotten to us, 
            <br>
            but do we hear them? 
            <br>
            As purple mist rolls down the mountainsides, 
            <br>
            I hear it.

        <br><br>
        Words of Gizem, thunderous and raspy, like stone. 
        <br>
        A voice I once regarded with love and friendship now holds the bitter taste of wounds covered yet not healed. 
        <br><br>
        “The world will be bent to its knees, 
        <br>
        Mine! Mine for the taking.” 
        <br>
        The cackles roll away, leaving nothing but the quiet whispers of the wind. 
        <br><br>
        I must help him! 
        <br>
        Gizem was once my treasured friend. 
        <br>
        I must go and see Ian at the chicken village. 
        <br><br>
        What is your name brave traveller?
