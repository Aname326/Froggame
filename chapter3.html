    <h1>
        chapter 3
    </h1>

    <div class="story"> 
        <p>
            The trek up the great walls of stone is not easy, 
            <br>
            my breathes come out in pants, 
            <br>
            my legs ach- AHTRHWGHEH!!!!! 
            <br><br>
            The deafening sound of trees crashing down makes me scream with fright, 
            <br>
            as does the bleating of a rather angry goat. 
            <br><br>
            Muttering to myself, I say “my goodness, 
            <br>
            what on earth is this noise, 
            <br>
            has the entire world gone mad?”
            <br><br>
            Well of course it hasn’t, 
            <br>
            but perhaps the Toad is, 
            <br>
            because when finally the goat is in my view, 
            <br>
            I see the same purple fog that seems to drive them rabid. 
            <br>
            Yet still, that cursed goat is charging towards me.
            <br><br>
            Trees fly everywhere, 
            <br>
            his horns bat into the roots, 
            <br>
            flying them all around me, 
            <br>
            the branches fly dangerously close. 
            <br>
            My voice barely rises over the din.
