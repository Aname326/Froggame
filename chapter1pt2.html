            As my voice rises through the prelude, 
            <br>
            climbing into a crescendo as I reach the chorus, 
            <br>
            blaring into the sky around us, 
            <br>
            and as I reach the coda, 
            <br>
            I see the purple fog clear slowly from Ian, swirling away.
            <br><br>
            “Thank you my friend!” 
            <br>
            “My pleasure,”
            <br>
            “How can I repay you?”
            <br>
            “Have you seen any traces of the Unpleasant Toad, I must go there immediately!”
            <br><br>
            “Seen I have not, 
            <br>
            all I remember was the face of the Unpleasant Toad and purple fog. 
            <br>
            Follow it, and see where it leads you to.
            <br>
            Perhaps that is where the answer lies.”
            <br><br>
            “I see, come with me Ian? It would be like old times again.”
            <br>
            “Nay, I would but this curse has left me hollow. 
            <br>
            Rest would be the only thing that would help. I wish you luck on your journey.”
            <br>
            “Take care Ian.”
            <br><br>
            I walk down the winding roads, away from the chicken village 
            <br>
            before the purple swirls of fog envelop me, choking me slowly. 
            <br>
            But just as quickly as they come, they disappear.
