            Walking through the long grass and into the bush, 
            <br>
            I hear chirping behind me. 
            <br>
            I barely duck in time, just to see the flying fluffball 
            <br>
            that is a quokka. 
            <br><br>
            “CHARLEEN!” I call. 
            <br>
            But she cannot hear me, 
            <br>
            like Ian was, her eyes are clouded with purple fog. 
            <br><br>
            “You shouldn’t be here”
            <br>
            “Charleen! Please, listen to me. 
            <br>
            The Toad has stolen what little sense you have, 
            <br>
            you must help me!"
            <br><br>
            “You are brave coming here, brave and foolish,” 
            <br>
            Balls of fluff rocket towards me like cannonballs
            <br><br>
            I must help her, 
            <br>
            she is just another victim to the Unpleasant Toad's master plan
